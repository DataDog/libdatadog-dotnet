# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by following the instructions at:

**https://www.datadoghq.com/security/?tab=contact**

This allows us to assess the issue, develop and test a fix, and release a patched version before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

## What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Potential impact
- Affected versions
- Any potential mitigations you've identified

## Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days
- We will send you regular updates on our progress
- Once the issue is resolved, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

Thank you for helping keep Datadog and our users safe!
